## Toy Problem Solutions

## This repository contains the Python solutions for the following toy problems:

1. Converting 12-hour time to 24-hour time
2. Two numbers are positive.
3. Consonant value

To run the solutions, simply run the Python files in your preferred environment.

## Challenge 1: Converting 12-hour time to 24-hour time

The function `convert_to_24hour(hour: int, minute: int, period: str) -> str` takes an hour (between 1 and 12), a minute (between 0 and 59), and a period (either "am" or "pm") as input. It returns a four-digit string that encodes that time in 24-hour time.

## Example usage:

```
>>> convert_to_24hour(8, 30, "am")
'0830'
>>> convert_to_24hour(8, 30, "pm")
'2030'
```

## Challenge 2: Two numbers are positive.

The function `two_positive(a: int, b: int, c: int) -> bool` takes three integers as input (a, b, and c). It returns True if exactly two out of the three integers are positive numbers (greater than zero), and False otherwise.

## Example usage:

```
>>> two_positive(2, 4, -3)
True
>>> two_positive(-4, 6, 8)
True
>>> two_positive(4, -6, 9)
True
>>> two_positive(-4, 6, 0)
False
>>> two_positive(4, 6, 10)
False
>>> two_positive(-14, -3, -4)
False
```

## Challenge 3: Consonant value

The function `consonant_value(s: str) -> int` takes a lowercase string that has alphabetic characters only and no spaces as input. It returns the highest value of consonant substrings. Consonants are any letters of the alphabet except "aeiou". We assign the following values: a = 1, b = 2, c = 3, .... z = 26.

## Example usage:

```
>>> consonant_value("zodiacs")
26
>>> consonant_value("strength")
57
```

Note: in the second example, we cross out the vowels to get "str" and "ngth". The values of these substrings are "str" = 19 + 20 + 18 = 57 and "ngth" = 14 + 7 + 20 + 8 = 49. The highest value is 57.

Enjoy solving these toy problems!
